# Rangoli

[Rangoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangoli) ASCII art in Python.
A Rangoli is an indian art form that originated from southern India.
This repo will print out a more ASCII and command line friendly version of a Rangoli artwork.
I also have support for printing a diamond to the console window.
More below.

## Usage

### Diamond
There are three different types of command line input that the script can take in.
To run the script, simply type `python diamond.py ` followed by one or more of the options listed below
Each of these options require a certain order.
That order is displayed below:

1. int ex. `3`
2. str ex. `A` or `AS` or `ASDF` where each string is a valid ASCII string
3. bool ex. `True`

### Rangoli

To run the script, simply type `python Randgoli.py`.
